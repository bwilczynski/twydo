# Twydo configuration

File: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/twydo/config.toml`, else `~/.config/twydo/config.toml` (Linux and macOS
alike). An empty `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` counts as unset. Unknown keys are an error and the message
names the key. Twydo only reads this file.

## Top-level keys

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vdir` | path | required | Root of the vdir: one subdirectory per list, one `.ics` per task. |
| `timezone` | IANA name | system zone, else UTC | Zone used for "today" and floating times. |
| `week_start` | `"mon"`..`"sun"` (or full names, any case) | `"mon"` | First day of the week. |
| `morning_time` | `"HH:MM"` | `"09:00"` | Time used for date-only tasks that need one (e.g. reminders). |
| `default_list` | list id | none | List new tasks go to. |

## `[lists.<id>]`

`<id>` is the collection directory name. A list without an entry gets the defaults below.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `archived` | bool | `false` | Treat the list as archived. |
| `hidden` | bool | `false` | Hide the list from the list pane. |
| `show_in_all` | bool | `true` | Include its tasks in the All view. |
| `show_in_today` | bool | `true` | Include its tasks in the Today view. |
| `show_in_done` | bool | `true` | Include its tasks in the Done view. |
| `sort` | `{ field, descending }` | `{ field = "due", descending = false }` | `field` is one of `due`, `start`, `creation`, `title`. |

These preferences are a local fallback. They are not stored in CalDAV and do not sync between
devices (spec section 5).

## `[[groups]]`

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | required | Group heading. |
| `lists` | list of ids | `[]` | Lists shown under the group. |

## Example

```toml
vdir = "~/.local/share/vdirsyncer/tasks"
timezone = "America/New_York"
week_start = "mon"
morning_time = "09:00"
default_list = "inbox"

[lists.bills]
show_in_today = false
sort = { field = "title", descending = false }

[[groups]]
name = "Home"
lists = ["inbox", "personal"]
```

Note: `~` is not expanded yet; use an absolute path.
